# FreeCodeCamp Learning Journey

This repository contains all my code and projects completed while learning on FreeCodeCamp.

For Backend Certifications (and future certifications project that needs to be deployed to a server), I will create a new repository for each certification and the projects will be added to the repository.

todo notes:
- deploy to vercel or CI/CD website
- Finish importing all site
